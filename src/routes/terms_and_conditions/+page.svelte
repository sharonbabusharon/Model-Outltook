        <h2>Fair usage policy</h2>
        <p>While our plans boast an array of unlimited features, it's vital to recognize their customization for enterprises spanning various revenue streams. Our goal revolves around democratizing Modeloutlook for everyone, offering them an equitable opportunity to enhance their operations and elevate their businesses.</p>
        <p>We emphasize the importance of prudent utilization and implore you to honour the autonomy we extend. Let's collaborate to sustain a harmonious and impartial experience that benefits all.</p>
        <p>Each project created is meant to be used for a single event and shared with the client as such. Also, using the gallery as a dumping ground for photos is not in line with fair usage. We firmly believe that adding meaningful photos to your gallery encourages your clients to keep the album for a longer time.</p>
        <p>Should your usage pattern align closely with that of our premium-tier clientele, we might kindly suggest contemplating a plan transition. This method is crafted to guarantee impartial assistance for users across the board.</p>
        <p>We have the right to terminate any account immediately if it is determined that there is unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity or your use of the product is in contrary to this policy.</p>
